    <h2>Density Functional Theory (DFT) - Basics</h2>
            <hr/>
            
     <p>
     The information of a quantum system can be obtained from the state function (or wave function), which is described by the <i>Schr&oumldinger equation</i> as $\hat{H} \Psi=E \Psi$.
     In this equation, $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator and $\Psi$ is a set of solutions of the Hamiltonian.
     Each of these solution $\psi_{n}$ has an associated eigenvalue $E_{n}$ that satisfies the eigenvalue equation.
     For a system consisting of <i>N</i> electrons, the time independent Schr&oumldinger  equation is a function of <i>3N</i> coordinates.
     To obtain an approximation solution of Schr&oumldinger equation, define the electron density as $n(\mathbf{r})=2\sum_{i}\psi_{i}^{*}(\mathbf{r})\psi_{i}(\mathbf{r})$,
     where $n(\mathbf{r})$ is a function of only 3 coordinates and contains a great amount of the information that is actually physical observable.
     The <b>density functional theory (DFT)</b> rests on the Hohenberg and Kohn theorem and Kohn-Sham equation.
     </p>
    
    <p>The <i>Hohenberg and Kohn theorem</i> states:
    <ol>
        <li>The ground-state energy from Schr&oumldinger's equation is a unique functional of the electron density.</li>
        <li>The electron density that minimizes the energy of the overall functional is the true electron density corresponding to the full solution of the Schr&oumldinger equation.</li>
    </ol>
    The <i>Kohn-Sham equation</i> is written as $\left[ -\frac{h^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}+V(\mathbf{r})+V_{H}(\mathbf{r})+V_{XC}(\mathbf{r}) \right]\psi_{i}(\mathbf{r})=\varepsilon_{i}\psi_{i}(\mathbf{r})$.
    Here, $V_{H}$ is the Hartree potential, and $V_{XC}$ is the exchange-correlation potential.
    </p>
    
    <p>The approximation of exchange-correlation potential includes local density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), etc.
    Two of the most widely used GGA functionals are the Perdew-Wang functional (PW91) and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (PBE).
