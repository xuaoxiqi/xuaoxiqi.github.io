Numerical approaches to model physical-chemical processes in porous media include:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Representative elementary volume (REV)-scale</strong> model,
which considers the presence of porous media based on empirical constitutive closures, 
such as the Kozenyâ€“Carman relation to estimate permeability, and the Bruggeman relation to estimate effective diffusivity. 
Although REV-scale models are computationally efficient, their accuracy rely heavily on the empirical relations.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Pore-scale</strong> model,
which considers realistic microporous structure and directly resolves detailed pore geometry. 
The constitutive closures, such as permeability or effective diffusivity as a function of porosity, can be calculated with the aid of pore-scale fluid flow/mass transfer information.
