    <h1>Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) - Particulate flows</h1>
            <hr/>
    
    <h2>Moving boundary</h2>
    <p>The LB method has received much attention in simulaing particulate flow, primarily because the fluid-solid interface can be easily implemented in the regular Cartesian grids, thereby improving the computational efficiency for moving particle simulations.
    Specifically, the no-slip boundary condition can be achieved by modifications on the density distribution function encountering the surface.</p>
    <p>An example of LB method for moving boundary simulation is given as below: the cylnder moves with a constant velocity, and vortex shakes off the cylinder.</p>

    <h2>Drafting-kissing-tumbling</h2>
<article class="articleScrapResearch">
    <aside class="asideScrapResearch">
    <p>Drafting-kissing-tumbling (DKT) scenario was first observed by <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112087001046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortes et al., 1987, J. Fluid Mech.</a>:
           For two particle with equal sizes settling in a channel, the trailing particle will first accelerate in the wake of the leader.
           When they come near contact, their center lines will rotate, and the trailing particle will fall around the other and then take the lead.</p>

    <h2>An elliptical particle setttling in a narrow channel</h2>
<article class="articleScrapResearch">
    <aside class="asideScrapResearch">
    <p>An elliptical particle is settling in a narrow channel.
    Although the particle translates in the downward vertical direction, it rotates as if it was contacting and rolling up the near wall.
    This sedimentaion mode is known as "tumbling mode" <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112008005521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xia et al., 2009, J. Fluid Mech.</a>.

    <h2>Mass point particles</h2>
    <p>In engineering applications, we may also treat particles as mass points to track large number of particles with low computational cost.
    Below is the animation of 2,500 particles motion in a lid driven cavity.</p>
